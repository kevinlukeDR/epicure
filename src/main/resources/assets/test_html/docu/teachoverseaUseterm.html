   <p><strong>A. </strong>The following terms and conditions apply to all Job Seekers, Employers, Publishers and other users who access or use the Site, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement.</p> 
   <p><strong>1. Job Listings</strong></p> 
   <p>HilandTalent Inc. may make available certain job listings and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (such listings and other contents, (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), through HilandTalent Inc.’s search results or otherwise through the Site. Job Listings are created and provided by third parties over whom HilandTalent Inc. exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that we have no control over Job Listings. Except for certain sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Listings contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. <strong><i>HilandTalent Inc. does not have any obligation to screen any Job Listing, or to include any Job Listing in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Listing from the Site for any or no reason.</i></strong> We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness or any Job Listing or other information submitted by any employer or other user, including the identity of such employer or other user. HilandTalent Inc. assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Listing. You agree that HilandTalent Inc. may also provide search options to narrow down Job Listing search results by job type (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such job types are created independently and entirely by HilandTalent Inc., and are not a direct reflection of the actual Job Listing.</p> 
   <p><strong>1(a) </strong>If you are a Job Seeker, any resume or application information that you submit through the Site is subject to this Agreement (including Section 4 below) and to HilandTalent Inc.’s Privacy Policy. Without limiting the foregoing, however, please note that by creating a public HilandTalent Inc. Resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing HilandTalent Inc. to make available your resume to any Employer that HilandTalent Inc. believes may have an interest in your resume. By creating or uploading an HilandTalent Inc. Resume, HilandTalent Inc. may contact you to share Job Listings with you that match the contents of your HilandTalent Inc. Resume. In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through HilandTalent Inc. Apply (hereinafter, all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “One Click
   Apply”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with HilandTalent Inc.” or any similar references are referred to as “HilandTalent Inc. Apply”) you are requesting and authorizing HilandTalent Inc. to reformat the job so that you may read it more clearly in your phone, you are sending your resume and application information to HilandTalent Inc., and you are requesting and authorizing HilandTalent Inc. to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s). When you ask HilandTalent Inc. to transmit an application or an email to an Employer via HilandTalent Inc. Apply or HilandTalent Inc.’s email relay system, you understand that this is without warranty. HilandTalent Inc. also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any such resume or application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data. However, HilandTalent Inc. may alert you when any of the above events occur. In addition, by using HilandTalent Inc. Apply, you agree that HilandTalent Inc. is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s application form, emails, screener questions, testing assessments or their format and that HilandTalent Inc. does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of emails from the Employer.

We cannot vouch for the validity of such contact information provided to us. If you do not feel comfortable sending an application or emails in this manner, do not use the HilandTalent Inc. Apply or HilandTalent Inc. email relay functions and please send your application or emails directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose. Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through HilandTalent Inc. being processed and analyzed by HilandTalent Inc. according to this Agreement and HilandTalent Inc.’s Privacy Policy. HilandTalent Inc. shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. HilandTalent Inc. may use your application materials (including public resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing,&nbsp;and HilandTalent Inc. may reach out to you about such Job Listing. &nbsp;<strong>HilandTalent Inc. does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.</strong></p> 
   <p><strong>1(b) </strong>If you are an Employer, when you create an HilandTalent Inc. account, a Career Site or post a Job Listing on the Site, whether as part of the HilandTalent Inc. Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement and all of HilandTalent Inc.’s policies, including the HilandTalent Inc. Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you and to the Job Seekers using such Career Sites or indicating an interest in such Job Listings. &nbsp;Specifically, when you create an HilandTalent Inc. account, HilandTalent Inc. may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called NetVerify. &nbsp;By using NetVerify, you send your identification documents directly to them and HilandTalent Inc. does not receive a copy of your identification documents. &nbsp;By submitting your identification documents for verification, you are agreeing to share it with NetVerify as per their Privacy Policy and NetVerify is solely responsible for any use or loss of data.

When using the HilandTalent Inc. Apply function, HilandTalent Inc. will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to HilandTalent Inc. by you, the Employer. HilandTalent Inc. has no ability to verify the contact information provided by You. In the event You&nbsp;provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify HilandTalent Inc. for any damages resulting therefrom. In addition, HilandTalent Inc. may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview. HilandTalent Inc. may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.&nbsp;</span>HilandTalent Inc. is not responsible for the content of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, and HilandTalent Inc. does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data. You agree that HilandTalent Inc. Apply is presented to you without warranty and HilandTalent Inc. assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility. By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting HilandTalent Inc. to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions. You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by HilandTalent Inc.. You also agree that you are only asking HilandTalent Inc. to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that HilandTalent Inc. will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions. You consent to HilandTalent Inc. listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with HilandTalent Inc.’s Privacy Policy. When you respond to or contact a Job Seeker who has used HilandTalent Inc. Resume, or HilandTalent Inc. Apply, you are providing information to HilandTalent Inc. and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker. Additionally, you consent to Job Seekers’ applications and any responses sent by you (including offer letters) through HilandTalent Inc. being processed and analyzed by HilandTalent Inc. according to this Agreement and HilandTalent Inc.’s Privacy Policy. HilandTalent Inc. shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. You are responsible for the contents of any Career Sites that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through HilandTalent Inc. Apply or otherwise, including any questions for Job Seekers. You agree that HilandTalent Inc. may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Career Site, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason. You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless HilandTalent Inc., its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without LIMITATION reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Career Site created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing). HilandTalent Inc. may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at HilandTalent Inc.’s discretion.</p> 
   <p><strong>1(c) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, when you send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, HilandTalent Inc. may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other HilandTalent Inc. product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. When you send, store or receive materials through or using the Site, HilandTalent Inc. may also inform a Job Seeker that an Employer has taken an action with regards to a Job Seeker’s application such as opening the application, viewing the application and making a decision with regards to the application, and you hereby consent to HilandTalent Inc. taking such actions. HilandTalent Inc. assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any job listing, career site, job solicHTAtion, screener question, answer to screener question, resume information you post, send or receive through the Site. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact HilandTalent Inc. to do so. HilandTalent Inc. does not promise to correct any inaccuracy.</p> 
   <p><strong>1(d) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, HilandTalent Inc. may use application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing, and vice-versa. Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, you agree and consent that HilandTalent Inc. may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and presenting them to Employers as matches or not matches. HilandTalent Inc. may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other HilandTalent Inc. product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p> 
   <p><strong>1(e)</strong>&nbsp;Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, HilandTalent Inc. may include salary estimations on certain Job Listings and pages on the Site. Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to HilandTalent Inc.. These figures are given to HilandTalent Inc. users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.</p> 
   <p><strong>2. External Sites</strong></p> 
   <p>The Site contains links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and/or operated by third-party vendors and other third parties (the “External Sites”). You acknowledge that HilandTalent Inc. is not responsible or liable for any such third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or through, any External Sites. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for the applicable External Site if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on an External Site.</p> 
   <p>In addition, HilandTalent Inc. may provide you with links to certain third party sites that offer you services for your use or benefit. We may stop offering any such third party sites or services at any time. If you choose to use such third party sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at your own risk. When entering into an agreement with such parties, you are giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are determined by their privacy policies and terms of service. We are not responsible for any content or services provided these third parties, and disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such third parties. We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party. You will be notified on the site that these are third party sites and services, and not HilandTalent Inc..</p> 
   <p>For example,&nbsp;HilandTalent Inc. may provide Employers with access to a third party site<wbr>, which allows Employers to send Job Seekers certain skills assessment tests. HilandTalent Inc. does not review these skills assessment tests, and any Employer’s use of them and Interviewed.com is solely at its own risk. Additionally, HilandTalent Inc. does not grade the results of the skills assessment tests. However, an Employer may choose to store the results of a Job Seeker’s skills assessment test on HilandTalent Inc.. HilandTalent Inc. reserves the right to remove access to third party for any Employer who, in HilandTalent Inc.’s sole discretion, abuses the third party service. Any Employer who uses this product shall indemnify HilandTalent Inc. for any and all claims arising out of its use of third party service<wbr>.</p>

   <p><strong>4. User Content</strong></p> 
   <p>Some parts of the Site, such as message boards and forums, may allow users to post Job Listings, resumes, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on or through the Site is referred to herein as “User Content”). Such functionality is designed to help users obtain career and company information, facilHTAte communication, discuss ways to make career decisions, and to let users know of jobs. User Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names. User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive. HilandTalent Inc. does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein. You acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that HilandTalent Inc. shall have no liability with respect to such content.</p> 
   <p>You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content. You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicHTAtions, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.</p> 
   <p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier. Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences. HilandTalent Inc. may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information. HilandTalent Inc. reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.</p> 
   <p>Although HilandTalent Inc. has no obligation to do so, HilandTalent Inc. may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in HilandTalent Inc.’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message, or that HilandTalent Inc. deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate. If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please <a href="http://www.HilandTalent.com/support/contact">contact HilandTalent Inc.</a> immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal. For clarity, HilandTalent Inc. does not have any obligation to remove any User Content, and the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any HilandTalent Inc. policy will always remain within the sole discretion of HilandTalent Inc..</p> 
   <p>HilandTalent Inc. reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that HilandTalent Inc. may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information. As an Employer, when you post a Job Listing on HilandTalent Inc. that you choose to list as confidential, your identity may be discoverable by request from the government or law enforcement.</p> 
   <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, HilandTalent Inc. reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p>

   <p><strong>10. Claims of Infringement</strong></p> 
   <p>U.S. Copyright Infringement. The DigHTAl Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by HilandTalent Inc. infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow HilandTalent Inc. to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send HilandTalent Inc. a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to HilandTalent Inc. Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ HilandTalent Inc..com) (remove spaces when sending email). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
