<h2 class="section-heading">Why Should You Get Certified?</h2>

<p>A TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate can give you a major competitive advantage when it comes to finding an ESL teaching job. Being a native English speaker certainly means you know how to communicate in your language, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you know how to explain the “why’s” of your language. </p>
<p>TEFL certification proves that you know how to explain the inevitable questions of English learners, particularly when it comes to tricky grammar and nonsensical pronunciation.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to Pick the Right Course:</h2>

<p>In order to determine what course you should take, you need to consider a few points:</p>
<ol>
	<li><h3>Time</h3>
		<p>Two options: onsite intensive, or online self-paced. We recommend onsite courses that include a practicum (see #5).</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Location</h3>
		<p>You can take it in your home country or attend a program in your target country (this can often be cheaper in the long run as program costs abroad are often lower).</p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Budget</h3>
		<p>Most high-quality and reputable programs cost around $2,000 USD. Although a big investment, keep in mind <strong>you get what you pay for</strong>.</p> 

	</li>

	<li><h3>Quality</h3>
		<p>Make sure you take an accredited course that is recognized world-wide. This can often determine the salary an employer is willing to offer, and you can check out the most reputable courses in the next section.</p> 

	</li>
	<li><h3>Practice</h3>

		<p>The advantages of having an on-site course is that you get real-life practice at applying the teaching concepts you have been learning. This is invaluable as studying from a textbook can never compare to managing a full classroom of students. </p>
