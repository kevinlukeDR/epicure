   <p>By using or accessing the Website, you are consenting to TeachOversea’s use of Cookies as follows:</p> 
   <p>This policy helps to explain the occasions when and why cookies may be sent to visitors to the Website (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”). “Cookies” are text-only pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the Website to remember important information that will make your use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other value. Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or not. &nbsp;Like most websites, we use cookies for a variety of purposes in order to improve your online experience, for analytics and for marketing, but specifically we use Cookies on the Website for the following purposes:</p> 
   <ol> 
    <li>Analytical Purposes: We use Cookies to analyze user activity in order to improve the Website. For example, using Cookies we can look at aggregate patterns like the average number of job searches that users perform. We can use such analysis to gain insights about how to improve the functionality and user experience of the Website.</li> 
    <li>Your Preferences: We use Cookies to store certain user preferences on our Website. For example, we may store the recent searches you have performed in a Cookie so that we can allow you to easily repeat those searches when you return to our Website.</li> 
    <li>Marketing: We use Cookies from third-party partners such as Google and Facebook for marketing purposes. These Cookies allow us to display HilandTalent Incpromotional material to you on other sites you visit across the Internet. HilandTalent Incmay also share information about your behavior on the Site with third parties (including operators of third-party websites and/or social networking sites) in order to show you targeted advertisements and other content that has been customized for you.</li> 
    <li>Referral Tracking: We use Cookies to associate user activity with the third party website that referred the user to our Website, or to associate user activity that HilandTalent Increferred to a third party website. These third party partner websites receive credit for the activity of users they refer to our Website, or give HilandTalent Inccredit for the activity of users referred to such third party websites. We do not share any personal information or information about individual user activities with these partner entities.</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p>Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the Website.</p> 
   <p>Persistent Cookies remain in the cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of visitors to our Website, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used to return to the Website to help customize your HilandTalent Incweb experience. We may associate personal information with a cookie file in those instances.

   <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p> 
   <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HilandTalent Incvalues the trust our users and customers place in us when they give us access to their Personal Information. The Privacy Policy describes how we work to maintain that trust and protect that information.</span></p>

   <p><strong>2. Information Collected</strong></p>

In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., credit card number and related verification information). If you use any automated phone screening product, HilandTalent Incwill record and store your answers to an Employer’s screening questions and will&nbsp;</span>forward your answers to the Employer.

In each such instance above, you will know what data we collect through the Site, because you actively submit it.<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

Public resumes are available to anyone with access to&nbsp;</span>TeachOversea’s resume search application.

HilandTalent Incprovides two-way email proxy and relay services to the users of our HilandTalent Incproducts, including: HilandTalent IncResume, HilandTalent IncApply, and Post a Job. By utilizing this HilandTalent Incemail relay function in connection with any of the aforementioned products, you acknowledge that you are asking HilandTalent Incto send these emails on your behalf. We monitor, review, store and analyze your content (including your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, responses, offer letters and other materials) that you send, store or receive, including via automated means and otherwise, for data analysis, quality control, and to refine the Site or any other HilandTalent Incproduct or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for job seekers and employers, provide you with personally relevant product features, and to prevent and block fraud and spam or reduce unwanted mail). <span style="font-weight: 400;">Responses that go through TeachOversea’s email relay are relayed to the actual email address you have provided TeachOversea. When communicating through TeachOversea’s email relay, you will see an email address with an&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">@TeachOverseaemail.com&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or @TeachOverseamail.com ending. You retain no ownership rights in these email addresses, which are specific to Employers’ Job Listings, but owned by TeachOversea. TeachOversea’s email relay will show the name associated with your account or job application in the “To:” or “From:” field. Please note that since these email proxy and relay services depend&nbsp;on the functionality of third party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers. If you share the TeachOversea-owned email address with someone other than yourself, and they send an email to this email address, HilandTalent Increserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of the sender of that email with the Employer associated with that email address’ Job Listing.&nbsp;</span></p>

Those companies are contractually required to treat such Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Please also be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be nonnegotiable</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures. However, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Information, by these companies. Please see paragraph 11 for liabilities related to the transfer of Personal Data for EU Residents.</span></p> 
   <p>You may also use certain third-party sites or services that you link to from TeachOversea’s Site. In such cases, all information you provide to a third party is provided to that third party and not to TeachOversea, and is subject to the third party’s privacy policy and terms of service.

If you post a public resume, this may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name.

If we are required to treat Non-Personal Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.</span></p>
